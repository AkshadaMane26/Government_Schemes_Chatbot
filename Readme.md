# PolicyGuide 🗺️ – Chatbot for Government Schemes

**PolicyGuide** is an intelligent chatbot designed to help users navigate Indian Government Schemes related to **Farmers**, **Education**, **Healthcare**, and **Women Empowerment**. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to understand user queries and respond with accurate information collected from verified government sources.

## 🔍 Features

- Multi-domain chatbot interface:
  - 🧑‍🌾 Farmer
  - 🎓 Education
  - 🏥 Healthcare
  - 👩 Women Welfare
- Data collected from authentic government websites and structured into `.json` files
- Trained using **Logistic Regression** and **TF-IDF vectorization**
- Django-based web frontend for category-wise interactions
- Modular architecture with separate models for each category

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Django**
- **NLTK** – for tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization
- **Scikit-learn** – for TF-IDF Vectorization and Logistic Regression
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – for the web frontend

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Training**:
   - Each domain (farmer, education, women, health) has its own `.json` file containing questions and responses.
   - Text is cleaned, tokenized, lemmatized, and vectorized using TF-IDF.
   - A Logistic Regression model is trained per domain.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - User types a question in the web interface.
   - Django view receives the message and routes it to the corresponding domain model.
   - Chatbot processes input and returns a suitable response.
